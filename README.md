## Installation

````bash
$ npm install piglow
````

## Setup

````bash
$ sudo vi /etc/modules
````

Add these two lines

````bash
i2c-bcm2708 
i2c-dev
````

````bash
$ sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.confa
````

Comment out blacklist i2c-bcm2708

````
#blacklist i2c-bcm2708
````

## Invocation

### From the commandline

````bash
$ piglow --leg_0 100 //lights up the 8 LEDs of the first piglow leg
````

Each parameter can be specified individually as a command line parameter. See the section [Adressing](#adressing) for a detailed overview.

When the parameter `mocked` is assigned, the parameters will not be passed to the piglow board but to a mocking backend. This is useful in a testing environment. (See the [Mocking](#mocking) section)

````bash
$ piglow --leg_1 100 --mocked
mock says:  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
````

Example
````bash
piglow --mocked --ring_0 100 --leg_1 --l_2_5 10
mock says:  [ 8, 0, 0, 0, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8 ]
````


The shorthand version can be used on the command line as well:

````bash
$ piglow --all --mocked
mock says:  [ 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255 ]
````

### From your script

```
var piGlow = require('piglow');

//callback fires when board is initialized
piGlow(function(error, pi) {
    pi.all;
});

```

## Adressing

</p>

To each LED a brightness value between 0 (off) and 255 (freakin' bright) can be assigned.
If one preferrs percentage values, as a convenience function all values smaller than 1 are treated as percentage values. Note that the value of '1' is not treated as 100% but as the brightness value of 1!

### Individual LEDs
```
//parameter sets the brightness:
pi.l_0_0 = 100; //sets LED 1 of leg 1 to a brightness of 100 (of 255)
pi.l_0_1 = 10; //sets LED 2 of leg 1 to a brightness of 10
pi.l_0_1 = 0.5; //sets LED 2 of leg 1 to a brightness of 50% (=brightness of 127)
...
pi.l_2_5 = 200; //sets LED 6 of leg 3 to a brightness of 200

//shorthand form:
pi.l_0_0; //sets LED 1 of leg 1 to a brightness of 255
```

### Legs
```
pi.leg_0 = 100; //sets all LEDs of leg 1 to a brightness of 100

//shorthand
pi.leg_0; //sets all LEDs of leg 1 to 255
```

### Rings
```
pi.ring_0 = 100; //sets LED 1 of leg 1, LED 1 of leg 2 and LED 1 of leg 3 to 100

//shorthand
pi.ring_0; //sets LED 1 of leg 1, LED 1 of leg 1 and LED 1 of leg 2 to 255
```

As the rings are distinguishable by color (order from outer ring to the inner: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, white), they can be adressed via the rings color:
```
pi.red = 100; //sets the first ring to a brightness of 100

//shorthand
pi.red; //sets the first ring to maximum brightness
```


### All LEDs
```
pi.all = 100; //set all LEDs to 100

//shorthand
pi.all; //set all LEDs to 255 (watch your eyes)

pi.reset; //set all LEDs to 0
```

### Random
```
pi.random = 0.5;

//shorthand
pi.random;
```
The propbability of lighting up can be defined (`pi.random = 0.1;`) and is otherwise calculated via this formula: `(0.4 + Math.random() * 0.2);`.
The brightness is calculated via this formula: `parseInt(MAX_VALUE / 2 + (MAX_VALUE / 2 * Math.random()), 10)`

## Transactions

Each parameter that is set causes the backend to transfer the complete set of values to the piglow board.
Thus the following operation would cause three write operations:

```
pi.l_0_1 = 100;
pi.l_0_2 = 100;
pi.l_0_3 = 100;
```

The piglow-interface offers the possibility to open up a transaction and to commit it when all changes have been made. So the following code will cause only one write to the hardware board:

```
pi.startTransaction();
pi.l_0_1 = 100;
pi.l_0_2 = 100;
pi.l_0_3 = 100;
pi.commitTransaction();
```

This benefits performance especially when the LEDs are changed in high frequence.

## Animations
An animation consists of a bunch of interface configurations that will be subsequently invoked.
Between the different configurations transitions can be defined as well als transformation and invocation times.
A chaining interface makes the configuration of animations super simple.

Check the examples folder for animation examples.

### Usage
````javascript
var piglow = require('piglow');

var animation = piglow.animation;
var pi = piglow.piGlowInterface;

animation({interval:10, debug: true})
    .set().to(pi(['ring_0'])).after('0.1s')
    .set().to(pi(['ring_1'])).after('0.1s')
    .set().to(pi(['ring_2'])).after('0.1s')
    .fade().to(pi['leg_0']).after('1s').in('1s')
    .fade().to(pi['leg_1']).after('1s').in('1s')
    .fade().to(pi['leg_2']).after('1s').in('1s')
    .repeat(3)
    .start(function() {
        console.log('i looped 3 times, now Im done.');
    });
````

### Api

#### Constructor([options, [backend]])
Creates a new animation object.

Optional options object:
  * interval: defines in which interval LED updates should be made, default: 100
  * debug: activates debugging

The optional backend object can be used to inject a mocking backend (unit tests, non raspi environment etc).

#### fade()
Opens up a new `fade` transition context.

#### set()
Opens up a new `set` transition context.

#### to(piGlowInterface)
This directive relates to a certain context, openend by `set` or `fade`.
It defines to which LED configuration a transition should morph.

#### repeat(timeRange)
Defines how often or how long a animation should be run.
Possible parameters:
````javacript
    animation().repeat(1);          //runs exactly once
    animation().repeat('1time');    //runs exactly once
    animation().repeat('2times');   //runs exactly two times
    animation().repeat('10s');      //runs for 10seconds (animation loops will always be completed)
    animation().repeat('0.1s');     //runs for 100ms (animation loops will always be completed)
    animation().repeat('100ms');    //runs for 100ms (animation loops will always be completed)
````

If no repeat directive has been set the animation will run forever.

#### after(timeRange)
This directive relates to a certain context, opened by `set` or `fade`.
Defines how much time should pass until the transition gets started.
Check [Repeat](#repeat) for possible values.

#### in(timeRange)
This directive relates to a certain context, opened `fade`.
Defines how much time the fade transition should run.
Check [Repeat](#repeat) for possible values.

#### start([callback])
Starts the animation.
Accepts an optional callback that will be called when the animation has been finished.

#### stop([noCallback])
Stops the animation, if present the callback from the start command will be fired.
If the parameter `noCallback` has been set, the callback will not be invoked.

### Chaining animations

It is also possible to chain animations.

````javascript
var piglow = require('piglow');
var animation = piglow.animation;
var pi = piglow.piGlowInterface;

var rings = animation()
        .set().to(pi(['ring_0'])).after('0.1s')
        .set().to(pi(['ring_1'])).after('0.1s')
        .set().to(pi(['ring_2'])).after('0.1s')
        .set().to(pi(['ring_3'])).after('0.1s')
        .set().to(pi(['ring_4'])).after('0.1s')
        .set().to(pi(['ring_5'])).after('0.1s')
        .repeat('1times');

var legs = animation()
        .set().to(pi(['leg_0'])).after('0.1s')
        .set().to(pi(['leg_1'])).after('0.1s')
        .set().to(pi(['leg_2'])).after('0.1s')
        .repeat('1times');

animation.jane({debug: true})
        .chain(rings)
        .chain(legs)
        .repeat('2s')
        .start(function() {
            console.log( 'chain finished' );
        });
````

### Variations of interface configurations
For your convenience there are some additional ways of predefining LED values:

````javascript
var pi = require('piglow').piGlowInterface;

//create and set
var a = pi();
a.ring_0 = 100;

//initialize with predefined values
var b = pi({'ring_0': 100, 'l_1_1': 10});

//initialize with maximum brightness
var c = pi(['ring_5']);
````

## Mocking

This module also exposes its internal structure, with the possibility to invoke the piGlow interface with a injected mocking backend:
```
var piGlow = require('piglow');
var PiGlowBackendMock = piGlow.BackendMock;
var piGlowInterface = piGLow.piGlowInterface;

var myMock = new PiGlowBackendMock();
var myInterface = piGlowInterface(myMock);

//lets hack
myInterface.ring_0 = 255;
```

This way the module can be used in a non raspi environment for development or with a testing mock for unit tests.
To implement your own mocks follow this interface:
```
function PiGlowMock() {}

PiGlowMock.prototype.writeBytes = function(bytes, callback) {
  //bytes is a array of 18 integer values between 0 and 255
};
```
